- ## Approach 1:- Brute Force

    - ### Intuition
        The task is to apply a set of operations on a list of integers (`nums`). Each operation consists of finding the smallest element in the list and multiplying it by a given `multiplier`. This operation is repeated **$k$** times.

        - #### Key Observations:
            1. In each operation, we are always modifying the smallest element in the list.
            2. The order of the numbers is important, as it affects which number gets multiplied.
            3. After applying the operation **$k$** times, the list will reflect the transformations based on the smallest elements repeatedly being scaled by the multiplier.

    - ### Approach
        1. **Initialization**:
            - We are given a list `nums` and need to perform `k` operations, where in each operation:
                - The smallest element in the list is multiplied by the `multiplier`.
        
        2. **Outer Loop**:
            - We loop `k` times, each time applying the operation of finding and modifying the smallest element in the list.
        
        3. **Inner Loop**:
            - Inside the loop, we traverse the entire list to find the index (`minIndex`) of the smallest element.
            - We use a conditional expression (`minIndex = index if nums[index] < nums[minIndex] else minIndex`) to track the index of the smallest element while iterating through the list.

        4. **Update**:
            - After identifying the smallest element, we multiply it by the `multiplier` and update the list.
        
        5. **Return the Final State**:
            - After all `k` operations, the final modified list is returned.

    - ### Code Implementation
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def getFinalState(self, nums: List[int], k: int, multiplier: int) -> List[int]:
                    # Perform the operation k times
                    for _ in range(k):
                        # Initialize minIndex to 0 (index of the first element)
                        minIndex = 0
                        
                        # Traverse the entire nums array to find the index of the smallest element
                        for index in range(len(nums)):
                            # Update minIndex if we find a smaller element
                            minIndex = index if nums[index] < nums[minIndex] else minIndex 
                        
                        # Multiply the smallest element by the multiplier
                        nums[minIndex] *= multiplier
                    
                    # Return the modified nums array after k operations
                    return nums
            ```
        - **C++ Solution**
            ```cpp []
            class Solution {
            public:
                vector<int> getFinalState(vector<int>& nums, int k, int multiplier) {
                    // Perform the operation k times.
                    while(k--) {
                        // Variable to store the index of the smallest element in the array.
                        int minIndex = 0;
                        
                        // Traverse the array to find the index of the smallest element.
                        for(int index = 0; index < nums.size(); ++index)
                            // Update minIndex if a smaller element is found at the current index.
                            minIndex = (nums[index] < nums[minIndex]) ? index : minIndex;
                        
                        // Multiply the smallest element by the multiplier.
                        nums[minIndex] *= multiplier;
                    }

                    // Return the modified array after k operations.
                    return nums;
                }
            };
            ```

    - ### Time Complexity
        - **Inner Loop**: For each operation, the algorithm checks every element in the list to find the smallest one, which takes **$O(n)$** time, where **$n$** is the length of the list `nums`.
        - **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `k` times, so the total number of iterations is **$k$**.
        - **Total Complexity**: The time complexity is **$O(k * n)$**, where **$k$** is the number of operations and **$n$** is the length of the list.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - **In-Place Modification**: The algorithm modifies the list in place, meaning we do not use any additional data structures except for a few variables (`minIndex`, `index`).
        - **Total Complexity**: The space complexity is **$O(1)$**, as the space used does not depend on the input size and is constant.
